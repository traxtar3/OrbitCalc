Package of Python modules and a main class with GUI

Instructions: Download all *.py files and place them in the same directory run $ python OrbitCalc.py

Dependancies: Python 2.7 or higher

Modules required: numpy math datetime GTK3+

Can perform the following: Tab1: RV2COE Converts Cartesian ECI R&V state values to Keplerian ElSet (Common Orbital Elements)

Tab1: Hohman Transfers Calculates the delta-V necessary to transfer to higher or lower orbit -assumes circular orbit with no plane change

Tab1: Plane Change Calculates the delta-V necessary to change satellite inclination -assumes circular orbit

Tab1: Rendezvous Calculates the delta-V necessary to transfer to higher or lower orbit to meet a target

Tab1: Drift Rate to SMA calculates the Semi-Major Axis given a drift rate relitive to GEO e.g( ~-1deg/day Eastward drift = SMA of 42242 km, 78 km below the GEO belt calculates the drift rate given a Semi-Major Axis relitive to GEO e.g -78 km = ~1deg/day Eastward drift

Tab1:Distance to Target calculates the minimum and maximum miss distance between 2 satellites given SMA, angualar seperation, and inclination

Tab1: Drift Rate / delta-V calcuates the optimum drift rate to arrive at target location calculates the delta-V required to acheive a given drift rate

Tab1: Collison Probability Given 2 assets' position and covariance matrix (error ellipsoid), calculates 1,2, & 3 sigma probability of collsion

TODO: -change # of significant digits for some of the items -make the GUI more aesthetically pleasing

Big thanks to Dave, Jake and Pat for all the help on my first big Python project!
